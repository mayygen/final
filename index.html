        <h1> Asian Fetishization: </h1>
        </div>

        <div class="centeredParagraph">
          <p> Racial fetishization comes in many shapes and forms. It can be
             thought of as the act of making someone an object of sexual desire
             based on some aspect of their identity. Asian fetishization,
             particularly of Asian women, is often associated with ideologies
             of submissiveness, obedience, and hypersexualization. Moreover, Asian
             fetishization ties closely into appropriation of the culture.

        <h2> History </h2>
        </div>

        <div class="rightParagraph">

          <p> The fetishization and sexualization of Asian Women is not a new
            phenomenon. Vox’s Li Zhou reports, “Asian American women have been
            exoticized and fetishized as sexual partners as far back as the 1800s.”
            Asian patriarchal culture created a twisted beauty standard for
            Asian women. They are seen as submissive, young, skinny, pale,
            and look easy to be controlled. This beauty standard is completely
            formed by the male gaze.
           </p>

           <p>
             In America, Even before the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which
             banned Chinese immigrants from becoming US citizens, the US had
             passed the Page Act of 1875, which ultimately banned the importation
             of Asian women, who were feared to be engaging in prostitution
             in the country, whether they were or not.
           </p>

           <p> Another potential origin of Eastern Fetishization comes from the
             emergence of films and artwork after US-led wars in Asian countries
             is when the trope of the hypersexual but docile Asian woman really
             took hold in America. For example, with anime (which has been
             steadily gathering a worldwide fanbase, since the release of Akira in 1988)
             there exist recurring tropes that have adverse effects on women.
             There often exist female characters that are hyper-sexualized for
             the purpose of fan service. Moreover, the women in some of these
             series often serve no purpose other than to look sexy and keep men
             interested.

          <p><b>Fashion: </b>Cultural appropriation through fashion is common and often sidelined.
            Much of traditional clothing is not simply functional or ornamental
            but is infused with meaning, and is part of the identity of the
            Indigenous communities that use it. Copying/consuming designs without
            consideration for their underlying cultural significance can erode
            the identity of a whole community.

          <p>Keziah Daum, an 18-year-old senior at Woods Cross High School, Utah,
            received backlash after she posted photos of her dressed in a red
            qipao, a traditional Chinese dress, on prom night. “For it to simply
            be subject to American consumerism and cater to a white audience,
            is parallel to colonial ideology,” an Asian-American student on
            twitter wrote. At the time, she said, she was only focused on the
            modesty and subtle elegance of the dress. She said she was not
            aware of the cultural context that’s deeply embedded with the
            garment’s history, one that can be traced back to the 17th century.
            The qipao, or cheongsam (in Cantonese), is a symbol of liberation
            and sensuality, it shapes and has been shaped by the shifting
            silhouettes of Chinese society through the tides of time.

        <h1> How can we appreciate and not appropriate? </h1>
        </div>

        <div class="centeredParagraph rellax" data-rellax-speed= "5.8"data-rellax-percentage="0.5">
          <p> The first step is to fully understand why this is an issue at all.
            Cultural appropriation’s toxicity is hard to fully comprehend if you
             don’t have an understanding of white supremacy. Adopting parts of
             oppressed cultures while actual members of said cultures are
              demonized is definitely tough ground. Admittedly, there is a
              fine line between appropriation and appreciation, and many
              grow frustrated trying to differentiate. Is there a right way
              to consume a culture without appropriating it? Everything is
              situational, but there exist common factors that can guide
              one’s consumption. For example, learning the background of
              the aspect of the culture you want to consume. Some things
              you can ask yourself if you are not sure if you are being
              respectful is:
           </p>

           <p>
             1. Am I reducing the value of whatever it is I'm consuming? (i.e. reducing cultural clothing to a "fashion statement")

           </p>

           <p>
             2. Am I in an environment where this is appropriate? (possibly regarding history of the entity)
           </p>

           <p>
             3. Are people of this culture the ones who are profiting off of this?
