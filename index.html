          <p> Racial fetishization comes in many shapes and forms. It can be
             thought of as the act of making someone an object of sexual desire
             based on some aspect of their identity. Asian fetishization,

             of Asian women being submissive, obedient, quiet. Moreover, Asian
             fetishization also ties closely into appropriation of the culture.
